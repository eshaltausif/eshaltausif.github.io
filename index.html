      <h2>My Schooling</h2>
    <h1>I HAVE SURVIVED...</h1>
    <h3>8 years of Primary School</h3>
    <p>I have been so far tortured and tormented in previous primary school years with... Math!
      The worst thing ever concocted in history so far. I tried my best to reason with my teachers to
      use something much more better called English, but nobody agrees. My favourite subject of all
      in school has always been and forever will be English. The worst: Math. My fellow peers understand
      my fear of math but no so much with the adults.My favourite pastime is reading. Books are the best
      invention made. I am normally found reading in the sunlight on a warm summer day or curled up in my
      bed reading on a crisp, wintry day. This nobody understands, not even my friends who are quite
      concerned about why I love reading this much. </p>
